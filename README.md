In this video I explain the following:

- What is github?
   - used to store files/code
   - allows for real time collaboration of files/code between users (version control etc.)
- Why are we using github
  - github will be used to store all device configurations and a link to the repo will be placed in all the video descriptions
  - The repo will also hold a step by step guide so that the user can follow us while we perform the lab
  - This will allow a more streamlined and interactive user experience
- How to use github to access:
   - initial configurations
   -  final configurations
   -  Read me guide for step by step instructions on how to complete the lab
- explain difference between a private and public repository
    - show access to a private repo
    - change repo to public repo
    - show access to a public repo
